|> Skill Level
|-> allow customization of individual tweaks in a custom preset
|--> this will not replace the existing presets
|
|> Assaults
|-> overhaul and re-enable hiding Cloakers
|--> the vanilla system is incredibly wasteful for less benefit than an assaulting Cloaker
|--> cycle hiding spots instead of leaving the map after some time
|--> potentially silence spawn noise, and silence idle noise while in hiding
|---> unsure if this is doable ASS-side, need to check if it syncs
|
|> Hydras mutator
|-> support spawning hrt_4 mapped units (Bronco cops) in Hydras mutator
|--> potentially as an option for normal play too
|-> tier tracking for Hydras mutator instead of always using lower tier
|--> eg, FBIs won't split into cops with SWAT-FBI Level Mod
|
|> Loud heists
|-> look into making diff progression based on heist progression, not based on survived assault waves
|--> some already do, but others (even loud-only heists like Green Bridge) don't
|--> refer to Avalon's Shadow scripting for stealth-possible heists
|
|> Panic Room
|-> finish custom scripting related to anti-cheese navlinks
|-> reenforce could potentially be useful after all
|--> still pretty easy to move around even if RNG isn't on your side
|
|> Slaughterhouse
|-> more variation in pig amounts
|-> more Murkies
|
|> Undercover
|-> redo with custom script
|-> more inside spawns
|-> Cloaker spawns for all vents
|-> look into if saw/hack timers can be changed ASS-side
|
|> Bank Heist/Firestarter day 3
|-> add ambush in the vault
|
|> Mountain Master
|-> set up sniper toggles
|
|> Lost in Transit
|-> set up sniper toggles
|
|> Ukrainian Job
|-> disable sniper spawns on the vantage point area when players are near
