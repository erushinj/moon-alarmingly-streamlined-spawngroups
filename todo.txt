External - players (like you) can feel these changes
- set up toggles for snipers on Mountain Master and Lost in Transit
- set up a toggle to disable certain sniper spawns with Ukrainian Job's vantage point purchased (maybe add new spawns ?)
- overhaul and re-enable hiding Cloakers (the vanilla system is incredibly wasteful for less benefit than an assaulting Cloaker)

Internal - backend only, players won't really feel it
- rename unit categories for clarity
