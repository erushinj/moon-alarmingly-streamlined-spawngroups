|> Assaults
|-> overhaul and re-enable hiding Cloakers
|--> the vanilla system is incredibly wasteful for less benefit than an assaulting Cloaker
|
|> Hydras mutator
|-> support spawning hrt_4 mapped units (Bronco cops) in Hydras mutator
|--> maybe as an option for normal play too ?
|-> tier tracking for Hydras mutator instead of always using lower tier
|--> eg, FBIs won't split into cops with SWAT-FBI Level Mod
|
|> Panic Room
|-> finish custom scripting related to anti-cheese navlinks
|-> Cloaker ambush in the panic room ?
|-> maybe reenforce could be useful after all ?
|--> still pretty easy to move around even if RNG isn't on your side
|
|> Slaughterhouse
|-> more variation in pig amounts
|-> more Murkies ?
|
|> Undercover
|-> redo with custom script
|-> more inside spawns
|-> Cloaker spawns for all vents
|-> look into if saw/hack timers can be changed ASS-side
|
|> Bank Heist/Firestarter day 3
|-> Dozer ambush in the vault ?
|
|> Mountain Master
|-> set up sniper toggles
|
|> Lost in Transit
|-> set up sniper toggles
|
|> Ukrainian Job
|-> disable sniper spawns on the vantage point area when players are near
